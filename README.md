# rasa_RPSbot

This bot is made with the help of rasa and python
To run, first setup the virtual environment for rasa using 'source ./venv/bin/activate' if you have all the prerequisites installed for running rasa bot.
Make changes to nlu.yml,rules.yml,stories.yml domain.yml and actions.py to train the bot to perform any function other than playing rock papers scissors.
Open two terminals. Run the server in one and train the bot the in the other using 'rasa train', 'rasa shell'.
